## USAGE:
##    $ git force-pull

# Should auto-register itself as a git subcommand if this
# script is in your PATH

# Force pushing branches from different machines makes
# working directories dirty and a pain to fix.

# This alleviates that by combining the commands I
# normally run to checkout the latest version of
# whatever is found on your remote.

# NOTE: Use with caution, this will delete your
#       current working branch
