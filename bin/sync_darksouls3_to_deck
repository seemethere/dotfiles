# > Why does this exist?
# Dark Souls III on steam does not support steam cloud saves so this handy utility
# should make it easy to sync your cloud saves from your windows machine to your
# steamdeck easily.
#
# Setup / prerequisites
#   * steamdeck set up with ssh and ideally passwordless entry
#   * wsl2, preferably debian?
#   * And that's it!
#
# To run this you can download this file and put in a directory and just run bash
# against it.
#
# It even comes with a debug mode! prefix your command with VERBOSE=1 and you
# should see debug information
