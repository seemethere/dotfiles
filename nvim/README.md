# nvim-config

This is my attempt to migrate my neovim configuration from vimrc to lua.

This utilizes LazyVim as a starting point and then adds some of the things
I actually care about.

Installation:

```bash
# backup your old config
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
# clone this one into the correct spot
git clone git@github.com:seemethere/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim/
```
